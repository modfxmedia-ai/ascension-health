                The primary benefit of IV therapy is that it delivers needed
                nutrients directly to the bloodstream. Rather than waiting for
                nutrients to be absorbed through the digestive system, our
                patients can quickly receive them where the body will actually
                use them. Most therapies take between 15 and 30 minutes to
                administer — we even have patients come in on their lunch
                breaks.
