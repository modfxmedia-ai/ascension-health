                At Ascension Health, we offer joint injections to those
                patients struggling with joint pain. Joint pain can occur in
                any joint of the body, but most patients who experience joint
                pain tend to feel it in the wrists, knees, hips, or shoulders.
                Acute joint pain is typically the result of an injury or direct
                trauma, while chronic joint pain can be caused by rheumatoid
                arthritis or osteoarthritis.

                Persistent and/or severe pain that prohibits your ability to
                complete everyday tasks should be evaluated by a doctor. If you
                notice redness, joint deformity, swelling, or reduced range of
                motion, it&apos;s time to schedule an appointment.

                If over-the-counter medications and physical therapy prove
                unable to relieve your pain, we may proceed with another method
                of treatment such as joint injections. This non-surgical
                treatment option can not only help you experience pain relief,
                but also provide increased range of motion — which can make
                physical therapy more comfortable.
