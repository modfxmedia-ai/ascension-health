                Knee pain is increasingly becoming a more common problem in society. It is a complaint we see frequently. The most common complaint associated with knee pain is considered the normal &ldquo;wear and tear.&rdquo; The truth is there is no such thing as normal wear and tear. Osteoarthritis is one of the most common conditions that affect people&apos;s knees — a degenerative process that starts when there is dysfunction in how the joint moves and loads.

                At Ascension Health we look beyond the knee itself. The hips, ankles and lower back all influence how the knee tracks and carries weight, and small imbalances elsewhere often show up as knee pain. A thorough examination tells us where the real problem lives.

                Treatment usually combines chiropractic adjustments, joint injections when appropriate, and a progressive physical therapy plan to restore strength and stability. Many patients who came in expecting they&apos;d need surgery leave with a plan that keeps them on their own two knees.
