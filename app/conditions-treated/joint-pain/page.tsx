                Joint pain can occur in any joint of the body, but most patients who experience joint pain do so in the knees, hips, shoulders, or spine. Persistent and severe pain that prohibits your ability to complete everyday tasks should be evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible. If you notice redness, joint deformity, swelling, or reduced range of motion, please contact our office.

                Most joint pain has a clear, identifiable cause — osteoarthritis, an old injury that never healed correctly, repetitive strain, poor posture or inflammation linked to diet and stress. Our job is to find that cause and treat it directly so the pain does not creep back the moment medication wears off.

                Care at Ascension Health typically combines chiropractic adjustments to restore proper motion, targeted joint or trigger-point injections to calm inflammation, and physical therapy to strengthen the muscles that support the joint. For many patients this combination delivers the relief they had hoped surgery would provide — without the recovery time.
